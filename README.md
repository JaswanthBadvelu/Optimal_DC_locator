# Optimal_Distribution_Center_location

Finding the locations and optimal number of DC’s required in the USA for distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine.Detailed steps can be found in my medium article [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/determining-optimal-distribution-centers-locations-using-weighted-k-means-1dd099726307)

# Problem Description
The total COVID 19 cases count has passed the 7 million mark on 24th September in the USA. On the other hand, many countries like the UK claim that their COVID -19 vaccine development is in the final stages and will be released by the end of 2020. I thought it would be interesting to find out when the vaccine is finally released and distributed across all the hospitals, including clinical centers treating COVID-19 patients in the USA. If the US government is planning to make use of Distribution Center’s to supply vaccination to all hospitals treating COVID-19 patients, Where should DC’s be located? How many DC’s are needed?
